UniverseStream is a TV-first IPTV player for Android TV built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, Hilt, and Media3.

It is designed for large playlists, remote-friendly browsing, fast provider switching, and a polished living-room playback experience. UniverseStream supports `M3U` playlists, `Xtream Codes`, `Stalker Portal`, and `Jellyfin` providers, with dedicated flows for `Live TV`, `Movies`, and `Series`.

Built for Android TV first, UniverseStream focuses on the things generic IPTV apps usually get wrong: D-pad navigation, quick channel movement, large-library organization, and a player that still feels good to use from the couch. Phone and tablet installs are also supported, but the primary UX target is TV.

## Quick TV Tips

- Long-press a channel, movie, or series to add it to Favorites or a custom group.
- Long-press a live category to open category actions such as pin, hide, lock or unlock, and custom-group actions like reorder.
- In Movies and Series, long-press categories or custom groups for hide or group-management actions where available.
- Long-press a live channel to queue it for Split Screen.
- Use the number keys on a remote while in the player to jump directly to a channel.
- While watching a series, open Episodes in the player to switch episodes without backing out to the details page.

## Download

- [Download latest UniverseStream.apk](https://github.com/Davidona/UniverseStream-IPTV/releases/latest/download/UniverseStream.apk)
- The app can also detect and download newer releases in-app through GitHub Releases.
- GitHub Actions still runs build and test validation on pushes and pull requests.
- GitHub Releases are now published only when the workflow is started manually with `workflow_dispatch`, so versioned releases do not get created by mistake on every push.
